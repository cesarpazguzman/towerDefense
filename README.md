# towerDefense
It's a simple tower defense. The enemies look for their targets (in this case Crystals) using the 
algorithm BFS (Breadth-first search). There are two types of turrets, one of them shoot bullets and 
the other shoot a beam of light that damages enemies over time. 
The scenario is divided on a square grid.
